# Nightly ESP8266 Deauther Builds

Under [releases](releases) you can find daily compiled .bin files.  

**Please note:**   
* They are compiled using the default settings for an ESP8266 with 1MB flash.  
* Only compiles only for [ESP8266 Deauther Version 3](https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther/tree/v3).  
* These builds are run after each commit, but overwrite existing builds from the same day.
